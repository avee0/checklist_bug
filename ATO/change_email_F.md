This logical flaw leads to account takeover. 
STP:
    1. Create two account as victim@gmail.com and attacker@gmail.com where each denote victim and attacker respectively.
    2. From attacker account, change email to 123@gmial.com and a link will be sent to that mailbox
    3. Copy that link and paste it in victims account and u can see that victim email will be updated.

REASON: The email verification link isent tied to users account and will update anyones mail if a user visits the email change link
