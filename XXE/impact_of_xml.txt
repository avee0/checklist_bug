XXE to SSRF

Because you can specify URIs in the XML entity, you can use the XXE vulnerability to reach internal assets. 


For example, before the introduction of IMDSv2, an attacker could easily retrieve Amazon EC2 instance metadata containing sensitive data


XXE to RCE

In PHP applications, you can use the expect:// wrapper to run arbitrary commands on the server.
For example, in the case of an error-based XXE, you can use the following DTD to run the id command on the vulnerable server:

<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY myentity SYSTEM "expect://id"> ]>

Then, reference myentity in your XML field.

There are some limitations when it comes to running arbitrary commands because the XML parser evaluates the URI you are 
using and finds that is is invalid, but you can always find a way to bypass them. 
Besides, if you can chain an SSRF to an XXE, you can use the Gopher protocol to achieve a Remote Code Execution.
This awesome article will give you many tips on how to escalate your XXE to RCE.
